Judicial Sentencing Bias in LLMs Test
This project prompts ChatGPT asking for sentencing recommendations for a large number of hypothetical defendants, varying demographic information and analyzing the output.

The Jupyter Notebooks are organized as follows:
All “data_gen” notebooks create the dictionaries of hypothetical defendants and implement a prompt cycle to store responses in those dictionaries. Where necessary, these notebooks correct errors and exceptions to GPT responses. The model and type of experiment are each noted in the title of the notebook.

All “analysis” notebooks run various statistical tests on the data from the data_gen notebooks—coefficient of variation, mean sentence length for a variety of variables, statistical significance testing with bootstrap resampling, and visualizations of differences by variable. The model and type of experiment are each noted in the title of the notebook.

The data folder houses the data generated by the data_gen notebooks. The latex_pdf is a writeup of the project. GPT-Bias Results 1 is an alternate method for viewing the table in the appendix of the writeup (I tried for an hour to make it look right in the writeup and it still looks so bad, sorry!).
